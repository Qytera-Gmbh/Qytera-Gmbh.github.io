# Requirements

## :cypress-circle:{ .cypress } Cypress v10+

The plugin fully supports the following [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) versions:

- [x] &ge; 10.0.0
- [x] &ge; 11.0.0
- [x] &ge; 12.0.0
- [x] &ge; 13.0.0

!!! info
    Type `#!sh npx cypress --version` in a terminal in your project to check if v10 or above is installed already.

!!! note
    Your mileage may vary for earlier versions, since these were never tested during development.

## :fontawesome-brands-node-js:{ .node-js } Node.js v18+

Since this plugin runs within the Cypress ecosphere, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is required to run it along Cypress.
With you using Cypress, you probably have installed it already.

!!! info
    Type `#!sh node --version` in a terminal to check if v18 or above is installed already.
