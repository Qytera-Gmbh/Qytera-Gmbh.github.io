# Setup QTAF in VSCode

Front-end developers mostly use VSCode IDE for developing front-end applications, so it is of great importance that they can also start back-end projects with VSCode.

To test the QTAF implementation under VSCode, Java 17 should first be installed on the system, there are several tutorials on this. The following instructions show how to install Java 17 on different operating systems:

To run tests, the Java Pack Extension adds the button "Run/Debug" next to the test classes, as in classic Java IDEs (Eclips or Intellij)
